## Introduction
We study how human writers use questions in academic writing and how these questions influence human reading comprehension.
To this end, we
1. curate GuidingQ, a dataset of in-text questions in textbooks from [Openstax](https://openstax.org/) and research articles from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) and [Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
2. fine-tune various LMs to generate these questions to promote active reading.   
3. conduct a human study to investigate the effect of such questions.

## Dataset
Our dataset is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BlMUkQAt95pL8V4Mj_Y9I-X8FPCiWNl9/view?usp=drive_link.

Each example consists of 
```
{
    "id": "article_id",
    "title": "article_title",
    "article": "list of article sentences",
    "questions": "list of extracted questions and their information"
}
```

## Experiment
+ Code for model training and evaluation: [src](https://github.com/eth-lre/engage-your-readers/tree/main/src).
+ Usage: [src/main](https://github.com/eth-lre/engage-your-readers/blob/main/src/main.py).
+ Model ckpt: [finetuned models]().

## Human Study

We release our human study UI for similar research in the future. See a [demo version](https://vilda.net/s/reading-comprehension-help/?uid=demo_paper&phase=2).

Screen pipeline:
1. Demographic questions
2. Intructions
3. Reading task
4. Performance questions
5. Project questions
6. Reading interface (again) with question annotation
7. Exit

### Running this Experiment Interface

First you need to start the logger locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/zouharvi/annotation-logger.git
cd annotation-logger
# run it in the background
nohup python3 main.py &
```

Then, build 

```
git clone https://github.com/zouharvi/reading-comprehension-help
cd reading-comprehension-help/annotation_ui
npm install
# run locally and use local logger, not the live one
npm run dev
# go to this url which loads the file `annotation_ui/web/queues/demo_authentic.jsonl`
xdg-open localhost:9001?uid=demo_authentic
```

You can go from here by adding new user queues to `annotation_ui/web/queues` and loading them with the `uid=` parameter.
