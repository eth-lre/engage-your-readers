        This task has 3 subsequent parts.

        <h3>1. Article reading</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>Read an article very carefully.</li>
            <li>You have 20 minutes for this part. Manage your time to ensure that you can read the entire article at a comfortable pace.</li>
            <li>As you read, we will display a series of questions on the right side, each linked to its context within the article. These questions are designed to help you understand the content. When you encounter a question, make sure to read and comprehend it before moving on.</li>
            <li>You are <b>not required to answer</b> these questions immediately. Instead, think about the questions and keep them in mind as you proceed with reading.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Article-related questions</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>After reading, we ask you to answer a few questions about the article. Your answers should be exclusively based on the article's content, without incorporating personal opinions or external information.</li>
            <li>The use of any external tool, such as search engines, is not allowed in this part. Your true response is crucial for the validity of our research.</li>
            <li>You can not go back to the article during this period.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Project-related questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>At the end you will be asked questions about the interface and the experiment.</li>
            <li>This is the most important part of your participation, so please pay particular attention to your answers.</li>
        </ul>
