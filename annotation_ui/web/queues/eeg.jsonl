Movement toward a stimulus is considered a positive response, while movement away from a stimulus is considered a negative response.</p>\n       <p>Reproduction -- Single-celled organisms reproduce by first duplicating their DNA, which is the genetic material, and then dividing it equally as the cell prepares to divide to form two new cells. Many multicellular organisms (those made up of more than one cell) produce specialized reproductive cells that will form new individuals.

For example, many organisms regulate their body temperature in a process known as thermoregulation.

All three make a free market economy highly competitive and provide a vast array of products and services. Businesses can grow and merge, horizontally or vertically, and evolve into conglomerates or multinationals. </p>\n            <p>The most common form of business organization is a <span><strong>sole  proprietorship</strong></span>.  This type of business organization is extremely easy to start and manage since it is owned and operated by one person. The business owner can take charge and make important decisions, and also may keep all of the profits so long as he or she assumes all of the risk. In addition, proprietors do not have to pay any special taxes, simply pay the tax on the income brought in from the business. If, however, the business is not everything that the proprietor hoped it would be, he or she may close the business. There are a few disadvantages to this type of business. The main concern is the unlimited liability. The liability suggests that the owner is 100% responsible for the debts and obligations of the company. The proprietor will be financially responsible for the company. It is up to the owner to acquire capital through bank loans or other obligations. Unless the business is incorporateds to protect the proprietor, he or she can be sued by other individuals or businesses. In addition, the sole proprietor must hire, retain, and give incentives to employees, keep an inventory, manage the business, attract additional employees, and consider if the business should continue if he or she leaves the company.</p>\n            <p>The next most popular type of business is a <span><strong>partnership</strong></span>. A partnership is generally a business owned by two or more people. Generally, partnerships are most often found among doctors and lawyers, or in a business where the start-up costs may be prohibitive for just one person. There are two types of partnerships:  general and limited. A general partnership exists where all of the partners share the responsibility for all the aspects of the business. A limited partnership is when one or more partners do not participate in the business at all, but are instead financial partners or \u201csilent partners\u201d. They benefit when the business does well, but are only liable for what they contributed to the partnership financially. A limited partnership can protect those partners from being held liable for the business's debts. Some positive aspects of a partnership: it is easy to start up and manage with a partnership agreement, it has no special taxes and can easily attract investors, it is somewhat more efficient than a sole proprietorship, and the business may be able to hire additional employees. The main disadvantages to this type of business is that partners are responsible for each other\u2019s acts. If one partner takes all the money and runs off, then the other partner is still liable for the debts incurred by that partner. The partnership is limited in terms of its life. When one partner leaves or dies, the partnership is no longer valid and the company changes. </p>\n            <p>The third type of company is a <span><strong>corporation</strong></span>. This is a very large business that has an entirely different structure compared to a sole proprietorship or a partnership. The main strength of the corporation is that it is considered a \u201clegal entity\u201d. It has all of the rights and responsibilities than an individual has. Besides its legal status, the next advantage of a corporation is the ease with which it may raise revenue for the company. It has the ability to borrow from banks or it can sell off shares of its stock (ownership) or corporate bonds (written promises to repay a loan). It can hire professionals to represent it or work for it, there is a limited liability, it has an unlimited life so long as it is still operating, it is easy to transfer ownership in the form of company stocks, and there is name recognition. The disadvantages of a corporation are: the rules and regulations set forth by the government for corporations, the huge tax burden that they must pay as a corporation, the shareholders have little say in the operation of the business, and it is expensive to set up a corporation, to begin with.</p>\n            <h4><span><strong>Corporate Stock and Public Firms</strong></span></h4>\n            <p>Corporations may be private or public, and may or may not have stock that is publicly traded. They may raise funds to finance their operations or new investments by raising capital through the sale of stock or the issuance of bonds. Those who buy the stock become the owners, or shareholders, of the firm. Stock represents ownership of a firm; that is, a person who owns 100% of a company\u2019s stock, by definition, owns the entire company. The stock of a company is divided into shares. In most large and well-known firms, no individual owns a majority of the shares of the stock. Instead, large numbers of shareholders\u2014even those who hold thousands of shares\u2014each have only a small slice of the overall ownership of the firm.</p>\n           A firm receives money from the sale of its stock only when the company sells its own stock to the public (the public includes individuals, mutual funds, insurance companies, and pension funds). A firm\u2019s first sale of stock to the public is called an initial public offering (IPO). The IPO is important for two reasons. For one, the IPO, and any stock issued thereafter, such as stock held as treasury stock (shares that a company keeps in their own treasury) or new stock issued later as a secondary offering, provides the funds to repay the early-stage investors, like the angel investors and the venture capital firms. A venture capital firm may have a 40% ownership in the firm. When the firm sells stock, the venture capital firm sells its part ownership of the firm to the public. A second reason for the importance of the IPO is that it provides the established company with financial capital for a substantial expansion of its operations.</p>\n            <p>Most of the time when a corporate stock is bought and sold, however, the firm receives no financial return at all. If you buy shares of stock in General Motors, you almost certainly buy them from the current owner of those shares, and General Motors does not receive any of your money. This pattern should not seem particularly odd. After all, if you buy a house, the current owner gets your money, not the original builder of the house. Similarly, when you buy shares of stock, you are buying a small slice of ownership of the firm from the existing owner\u2014and the firm that originally issued the stock is not a part of this transaction.</p>\n           When a firm decides to issue stock, it must recognize that investors will expect to receive a rate of return. That rate of return can come in two forms. A firm can make a direct payment to its shareholders, called a dividend. Alternatively, a financial investor might buy a share of stock in Wal-Mart for $45 and then later sell that share of stock to someone else for $60, for a gain of $15. The increase in the value of the stock (or of any asset) between when it is bought and when it is sold is called a capital gain.</p>\n            Firms can be seperated into two groups: private and public. A private company is owned by the people who run it on a day-to-day basis. A private company can be run by individuals, in which case it is called a sole proprietorship, or it can be run by a group, in which case it is a partnership. A private company can also be a corporation, but with no publicly issued stock. A small law firm run by one person, even if it employs some other lawyers, would be a sole proprietorship. A larger law firm may be owned jointly by its partners. Most private companies are relatively small, but there are some large private corporations, with tens of billions of dollars in annual sales, that do not have publicly issued stock, such as farm products dealer Cargill, the Mars candy company, and the Bechtel engineering and construction firm.</p>\n            <p>When a firm decides to sell stock, which in turn can be bought and sold by financial investors, it is called a public company. Shareholders own a public company. Since the shareholders are a very broad group, often consisting of thousands or even millions of investors, the shareholders' vote for a board of directors, who in turn hire top executives to run the firm on a day-to-day basis. The more shares of stock a shareholder owns, the more votes that shareholder is entitled to cast for the company\u2019s board of directors.</p>\n            <p>In theory, the board of directors helps to ensure that the firm is run in the interests of the true owners\u2014the shareholders. However, the top executives who run the firm have a strong voice in choosing the candidates who will be on their board of directors. After all, few shareholders are knowledgeable enough or have enough of a personal incentive to spend energy and money nominating alternative members of the board.</p>\n            <h4><strong>How Firms Choose between Sources of Financial Capital?</strong></h4>\n            <p>There are clear patterns in how businesses raise financial capital. These patterns can be explained in terms of imperfect information, is a situation where buyers and sellers in a market do not both have full and equal information. Those who are actually running a firm will almost always have more information about whether the firm is likely to earn profits in the future than outside investors who provide financial capital.</p>\n            <p>Any young startup firm is a risk; indeed, some startup firms are only a little more than an idea on paper. The firm\u2019s founders inevitably have better information about how hard they are willing to work, and whether the firm is likely to succeed than anyone else. When the founders put their own money into the firm, they demonstrate a belief in its prospects. At this early stage, angel investors and venture capitalists try to overcome the imperfect information, at least in part, by knowing the managers and their business plan personally and by giving them advice.</p>\n            <h4>Government & Business Regulations</h4>\n            <p>When the United States was established, the idea of a competitive market free of government interference was a reality. However, since the late 1800s, the reality of a truly free market system has slowly evolved into a marketplace where the government has played an increasingly larger role.  The federal government and the states tried to regulate big business and corporate interests as the nation grew and the population demanded a certain degree of oversight. Government restrictions and legislation limited the growing power and influence of \u201crobber barons\u201d, trusts, and monopolies by the early 1900s. The intervention by the government on behalf of the population began a trend that has grown exponentially over the last one hundred years.</p>\n            <p>State governments today realize the importance of major industries and corporations and the impact that those businesses can have on the growth of a state\u2019s economy, employment, and resources. Both states and local governments have made attempts to attract corporations by offering tax breaks and relaxing restrictions.  Government benefits when businesses expand through payroll taxes, employment opportunities, and better wages for employees. Business benefit when governments offer incentives to relocate or expand.</p>\n            <p>Compared to one hundred years ago, businesses today are under a great deal more scrutiny and face an overabundance of regulations and restrictions on their business practices and treatment of consumers.  States can set insurance rates, regulate banks and insurance companies, determine whether or not a utility company can increase rates on customers, and prohibit certain industries from operating if they harm the environment.</p>\n            <p>In general, government and business need each other. Governors and even mayors (like here in El Paso) invite companies to visit in order to try to attract new business opportunities to specific locales.  Commercials, city chambers of commerce, and newspaper advertisements, all tout the benefits of relocating. Local governments may even go as far as selling municipal bonds or take on enormous debt to help finance the relocation of a company, such as when the El Paso City Council wanted to bring a Triple-A baseball club to the downtown area.</p>\n        </div>\n    </body>\n</html>"}

Businesses can grow and merge, horizontally or vertically, and evolve into conglomerates or multinationals. </p>\n            <p>The most common form of business organization is a <span><strong>sole  proprietorship</strong></span>.  This type of business organization is extremely easy to start and manage since it is owned and operated by one person. The business owner can take charge and make important decisions, and also may keep all of the profits so long as he or she assumes all of the risk. In addition, proprietors do not have to pay any special taxes, simply pay the tax on the income brought in from the business. If, however, the business is not everything that the proprietor hoped it would be, he or she may close the business. There are a few disadvantages to this type of business. The main concern is the unlimited liability. The liability suggests that the owner is 100% responsible for the debts and obligations of the company. The proprietor will be financially responsible for the company. It is up to the owner to acquire capital through bank loans or other obligations. Unless the business is incorporateds to protect the proprietor, he or she can be sued by other individuals or businesses. In addition, the sole proprietor must hire, retain, and give incentives to employees, keep an inventory, manage the business, attract additional employees, and consider if the business should continue if he or she leaves the company.</p>\n            <p>The next most popular type of business is a <span><strong>partnership</strong></span>. A partnership is generally a business owned by two or more people. Generally, partnerships are most often found among doctors and lawyers, or in a business where the start-up costs may be prohibitive for just one person. There are two types of partnerships:  general and limited. A general partnership exists where all of the partners share the responsibility for all the aspects of the business. A limited partnership is when one or more partners do not participate in the business at all, but are instead financial partners or \u201csilent partners\u201d. They benefit when the business does well, but are only liable for what they contributed to the partnership financially. A limited partnership can protect those partners from being held liable for the business's debts. Some positive aspects of a partnership: it is easy to start up and manage with a partnership agreement, it has no special taxes and can easily attract investors, it is somewhat more efficient than a sole proprietorship, and the business may be able to hire additional employees. The main disadvantages to this type of business is that partners are responsible for each other\u2019s acts. If one partner takes all the money and runs off, then the other partner is still liable for the debts incurred by that partner. The partnership is limited in terms of its life. When one partner leaves or dies, the partnership is no longer valid and the company changes. </p>\n            <p>The third type of company is a <span><strong>corporation</strong></span>. This is a very large business that has an entirely different structure compared to a sole proprietorship or a partnership. The main strength of the corporation is that it is considered a \u201clegal entity\u201d. It has all of the rights and responsibilities than an individual has. Besides its legal status, the next advantage of a corporation is the ease with which it may raise revenue for the company. It has the ability to borrow from banks or it can sell off shares of its stock (ownership) or corporate bonds (written promises to repay a loan). It can hire professionals to represent it or work for it, there is a limited liability, it has an unlimited life so long as it is still operating, it is easy to transfer ownership in the form of company stocks, and there is name recognition. The disadvantages of a corporation are: the rules and regulations set forth by the government for corporations, the huge tax burden that they must pay as a corporation, the shareholders have little say in the operation of the business, and it is expensive to set up a corporation, to begin with.</p>\n            <h4><span><strong>Corporate Stock and Public Firms</strong></span></h4>\n            <p>Corporations may be private or public, and may or may not have stock that is publicly traded. They may raise funds to finance their operations or new investments by raising capital through the sale of stock or the issuance of bonds. Those who buy the stock become the owners, or shareholders, of the firm. Stock represents ownership of a firm; that is, a person who owns 100% of a company\u2019s stock, by definition, owns the entire company. The stock of a company is divided into shares. In most large and well-known firms, no individual owns a majority of the shares of the stock. Instead, large numbers of shareholders\u2014even those who hold thousands of shares\u2014each have only a small slice of the overall ownership of the firm.</p>\n            <p><span id=\"question_1\"></span>A firm receives money from the sale of its stock only when the company sells its own stock to the public (the public includes individuals, mutual funds, insurance companies, and pension funds). A firm\u2019s first sale of stock to the public is called an initial public offering (IPO). The IPO is important for two reasons. For one, the IPO, and any stock issued thereafter, such as stock held as treasury stock (shares that a company keeps in their own treasury) or new stock issued later as a secondary offering, provides the funds to repay the early-stage investors, like the angel investors and the venture capital firms. A venture capital firm may have a 40% ownership in the firm. When the firm sells stock, the venture capital firm sells its part ownership of the firm to the public. A second reason for the importance of the IPO is that it provides the established company with financial capital for a substantial expansion of its operations.</p>\n            <p>Most of the time when a corporate stock is bought and sold, however, the firm receives no financial return at all. If you buy shares of stock in General Motors, you almost certainly buy them from the current owner of those shares, and General Motors does not receive any of your money. This pattern should not seem particularly odd. After all, if you buy a house, the current owner gets your money, not the original builder of the house. Similarly, when you buy shares of stock, you are buying a small slice of ownership of the firm from the existing owner\u2014and the firm that originally issued the stock is not a part of this transaction.</p>\n            <p>When a firm decides to issue stock, it must recognize that investors will expect to receive a rate of return. That rate of return can come in two forms. A firm can make a direct payment to its shareholders, called a dividend. Alternatively, a financial investor might buy a share of stock in Wal-Mart for $45 and then later sell that share of stock to someone else for $60, for a gain of $15. The increase in the value of the stock (or of any asset) between when it is bought and when it is sold is called a capital gain.</p>\n            <p><span id=\"question_2\"></span>Firms can be seperated into two groups: private and public. A private company is owned by the people who run it on a day-to-day basis. A private company can be run by individuals, in which case it is called a sole proprietorship, or it can be run by a group, in which case it is a partnership. A private company can also be a corporation, but with no publicly issued stock. A small law firm run by one person, even if it employs some other lawyers, would be a sole proprietorship. A larger law firm may be owned jointly by its partners. Most private companies are relatively small, but there are some large private corporations, with tens of billions of dollars in annual sales, that do not have publicly issued stock, such as farm products dealer Cargill, the Mars candy company, and the Bechtel engineering and construction firm.</p>\n            <p>When a firm decides to sell stock, which in turn can be bought and sold by financial investors, it is called a public company. Shareholders own a public company. Since the shareholders are a very broad group, often consisting of thousands or even millions of investors, the shareholders' vote for a board of directors, who in turn hire top executives to run the firm on a day-to-day basis. The more shares of stock a shareholder owns, the more votes that shareholder is entitled to cast for the company\u2019s board of directors.</p>\n            <p>In theory, the board of directors helps to ensure that the firm is run in the interests of the true owners\u2014the shareholders. However, the top executives who run the firm have a strong voice in choosing the candidates who will be on their board of directors. After all, few shareholders are knowledgeable enough or have enough of a personal incentive to spend energy and money nominating alternative members of the board.</p>\n            <h4><strong>How Firms Choose between Sources of Financial Capital?</strong></h4>\n            <p>There are clear patterns in how businesses raise financial capital. These patterns can be explained in terms of imperfect information, is a situation where buyers and sellers in a market do not both have full and equal information. Those who are actually running a firm will almost always have more information about whether the firm is likely to earn profits in the future than outside investors who provide financial capital.</p>\n            <p>Any young startup firm is a risk; indeed, some startup firms are only a little more than an idea on paper. The firm\u2019s founders inevitably have better information about how hard they are willing to work, and whether the firm is likely to succeed than anyone else. When the founders put their own money into the firm, they demonstrate a belief in its prospects. At this early stage, angel investors and venture capitalists try to overcome the imperfect information, at least in part, by knowing the managers and their business plan personally and by giving them advice.</p>\n            <h4>Government & Business Regulations</h4>\n            <p>When the United States was established, the idea of a competitive market free of government interference was a reality.

A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.</p>\n  <p>Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.</p>\n       <p>In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.</p>\n       <p>It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.</p>\n       <p>WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY? Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).</p>\n       <p>An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,” many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase students’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they encounter.</p>\n       <p>In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that shape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).</p>\n       </div>\n    </body>\n</html>"}
